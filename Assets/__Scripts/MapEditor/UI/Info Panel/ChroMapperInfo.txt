Here at Chroma® we value your eye-cone thingies.

A recent trend of duochromitis has plagued the VR community this last year, and we've decided to balance the playing field.

Chroma®, and it's big brother ChromaToggle™, can bring you up from your sad, rainbowless life into a world of Pentachrome™ magic. Experience the joy of having up to six different colours of blocks flying towards you at break neck speed! If that's not enough for you, we even offer a cacophony of Technicolour© lightwaves, to bring your eyes to their knees!

Now, with something as brilliant and Nobel Peace Price worthy as the Chroma Suite™, specialized software needs to be created to handle these beasts of technological engineering. That's where ChroMapper® comes into play!

ChroMapper™ makes it easy for the everyday Joe to use the power of Chroma© RGB™ to create lightshows and maps that are far superior to their duochromatic counterparts! Reality Check Through The Skull? Slap some Chroma on that mofo and you've got yourself a map worthy of Cube Community!

So, what are you waiting for? Stop living in your sad two-color world and join us enlightened individuals with the power of Chroma® RGB and ChroMapper™!

=========================================

Welcome to ChroMapper!

ChroMapper is an in-development, Unity based lightmapper for Beat Saber which specializes in the Chroma Suite of mods. Prepare to fill the eyes of yourself and others with powerful lightmaps that would make everyone flock to your Beat Saver page!

Because this is an early access build of ChroMapper (And not release!), bugs, issues, and other misconveniences can happen. If you encounter some of these, please go to #cm-bug-reports in the Chroma discord, or #cm-suggestions if you want to suggest something for me to add/improve. Somehow don't have Discord? Too bad!

Now, let's not delay any longer, time for the controls!
