LomontFFT.cs, FFT.cs and OnsetDetection.cs are modifications of code from https://github.com/Teh-Lemon/Onset-Detection.
Some modification were made and could be made according to https://github.com/nathanstep55/bpm-offset-detector/blob/main/original-paper/report.pdf
which describes the algorithm used by ArrowVortex, although the original Onset-Detection implementation was already very similar.
